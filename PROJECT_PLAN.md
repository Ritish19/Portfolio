## 3. Visual Effects & Animations

### Micro-Interactions
- **Hover Effects**: Smooth color transitions, scale transforms, shadow changes
- **Button Animations**: Ripple effects, loading states, success feedback
- **Form Interactions**: Focus states, validation feedback, auto-complete

### Page Transitions
- **Route Transitions**: Slide, fade, and scale animations between pages
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens, progressive loading
- **Scroll Animations**: Parallax effects, reveal animations, progress indicators

### Advanced Effects
- **Particle Systems**: Interactive background particles that respond to mouse movement
- **3D Elements**: Floating cards, rotating objects, interactive 3D models
- **Morphing Shapes**: SVG animations, blob effects, liquid transitions
- **Glassmorphism**: Frosted glass effects with backdrop blur
