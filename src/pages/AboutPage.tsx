                I'm a builder, fixer, and problem-solver who thrives at the intersection of curiosity, creativity, and adaptability.
                From dismantling engines to coding AI systems, from designing solutions to leading community projects, I chase ideas until I understand themâ€”and then I bring them to life.
                Whether I'm working with wires, words, or people, I adapt fast, learn deeply, and make things happen.

From learning how computers work on a hardware level and randomly learning how complex systems work. I try to discover and learn when I am struck with curiosity. Being this openly curious has not only helped me in Computer science but in general life too. I am a lowkey mechanic, 'jerry rigger', plumber, electrician, inventor musician and a lot of other things at the same time. If anything is interesting enough to be learnt, I will have already have a good idea of the basis of how everything works. I also like systems like engines and compressors and fridges and literally anything."

I have built obstacle detection cars, license plate detection and speed detection systems from a raspberry pi, crossbows, laptop stands, electronic parts, extended routers, and I basically fix everything around the house from the doorbells to taps, geysers, solar light, flush and everything you can do in the house. 'If I have the tools to do it, you bet I already did it'. My room is filled with wires and spare parts. I even fix my own motorcycle when it comes to it and when it gets to fixing mechanical parts I know exactly what's wrong. I am not just a computer science graduate I am a creative builder and the definition of 'jerry rig'. I have a habit of building systems. I unscrew things and stick my head into anything I find interesting."

But I put myself in positions where I have to adapt and be social or learn the systems around me. I am currently leading the governmental level youth club called Budanilakantha Youth Club and I am active in social initiatives and I don't back down when it comes to public speaking and putting myself out there. I was initially a very shy individual but over the years I have been in countless committees and have conducted and hosted multiple programs. From MUNs, Youth initiatives, public speaking or handling internships whilst studying. I write my own songs and I am also an esteemed designer. I do a lot and have a lot of social experience whilst also being niche and talented."
